I am a software developer from France that find the life too short to make all things I want to do.
If like me you think that you aren't enough productive when using C++ as main programming language you are wellcome here.

My center of interest in development is to improve my self in the capacity to use a hardware at his maximum potential. I worked
in the video game indrustry during 10 years, which allow me to develop on consoles with really few resources. Today I want to continue
to understand better how component like CPU and GPU,... in a PC are working. I started to write a programming language, [f-lang], few month ago
(march 2019) to learn things about the code generation and eventually do some ASM and SIMD,...
