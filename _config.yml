# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

### COMMENTS
# I followed the tutorial https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html to enable comments on my
# blog posts.

# The URL for the staticman API bridge endpoint
# You will want to modify some of the values:
#  ${github-username}: the username of the account with which you publish your blog
#  ${blog-repo}: the name of your blog repository in github
#  master: this the branch out of which your blog is published, often master or gh-pages
#  ${bridge_app_name}: the name you chose in Heroku for your bridge API
#  comments: the so-called property, this defines the key in staticman.yml where the configuration is found
#
# for me, this line reads:
# https://staticman-travisdownsio.herokuapp.com/v2/entry/travisdowns/travisdowns.github.io/master/comments
staticman_url: https://flamaros-staticman.herokuapp.com/v2/entry/Flamaros/Flamaros.github.io/master/comments

# reCaptcha configuration info: the exact same site key and *encrypted* secret that you used in staticman.yml
# I personally don't think the secret needs to be included in the generated site, but the staticman API bridge uses
# it to ensure the site configuration and bridge configuration match (but why not just compare the site key?)
